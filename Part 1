# How to change the data/variable type of a variable/column
5 variable types 
1) Numbers - numeric values - 4 numeric data types
  1a) int (signed integers) (no decimals)
  1b) long (long integers) (L on the end)
  1c) float (floating point real values) (can include decimals)
  1d) complex (complex numbers) (includes imaginary number as j)
2) String (continuous characters represented in quotation marks, single or double quotations)
  - subsets of strings can be made using the slice operator [] or [:]
    with index starting at 0 and working there way from -1 at the end.
3) List (items separated by commas and within brackets [], items can be different data types)
  - lists use the slice operator [] or [:]
  - lists can be concatenated using +
  - ilsts can be duplicated using *
4) Tuple (items separated by commas and within (), can't be changed similar to read-only)
5) Dictionary (items separated by commas and within {} )
  - values can be assigned and accessed using []
How to Change variable types
1 - int(x [,base]) - converts x to integer
2 - long(x [,base]) - converts x to long 
3 - float(x) - converts x to float
4 - complex(real [,imag]) - creates an complex number
5 - str(x) - converts x to string
6 - repr(x) - converts x to expression string
7 - eval(str) - evaluates a string and returns an object
8 - tuple(s) - converts s to a tuple
9 - list(s) - converts s to a list
10 - set(s) - converts s to a set
11 - dict(d) - creates a dictionary d
12 - frozenset(s) - converts s to a frozen set
13 - chr(x) - converts integer to a character
14 - unichr(x) - converts an integer into a unicode character
15 - ord(x) - converts a single character to its integer value
16 - hex(x) - converts an integer into a hexidecimal string
17 - oct(x) - converts an integer to an octal string
